## About

During my freelancing stint, I crafted bespoke Minecraft plugins tailored to the specific requests of a client.

## Features

- Anti-Fall Damage Boots: Engineered to defy gravity, these boots transform the ground beneath users into slime blocks upon impact, mitigating fall damage by enabling a rebound before seamlessly restoring the terrain to its original state.
- Teleporting Fishing Rod: Revolutionizing the art of fishing, this enchanted rod empowers players to reel in items from any location, introducing a novel and convenient twist to the traditional angling experience.
- Bat Enchantments: Introducing an element of chance, slaying bats now yields enchanted books, adding an enchanting surprise to encounters with these winged creatures.
- Netherite-Clad Zombie Bosses: Elevating the zombie experience, formidable bosses donned in full Netherite armor now roam the Minecraft world. Brave adventurers who conquer these bosses may be rewarded with a coveted Netherite ingot, adding a touch of high-stakes exploration.
- Player-vs-Player Scorekeeper: To inject a competitive edge, a comprehensive scorekeeping system was implemented, diligently tracking the number of player slayings. This feature adds a layer of intensity and rivalry to in-game interactions.
