## About

Introducing a web application tailored for organizations equipped with an array of specialized tools for measuring diverse human vitals. This platform simplifies the process of recording, tracking, graphing, and generating printable records for clients. Notably, this project holds sentimental value as it marks my inaugural freelance endeavor, a significant milestone in my development journey. Despite the initial pressure of delivering a finished product within a two-week timeframe, this simple CRUD app served as a valuable learning experience. Reflecting on it now, the strides in technology would enable me to develop and deploy a similar app in a fraction of the time, underscoring the continuous evolution in my skill set. The live website has undergone migration since its initial deployment, and its current hosting location is unknown to me. Regardless, sharing the live link wouldn't serve as an effective demonstration, as it is fully protected by login credentials.
