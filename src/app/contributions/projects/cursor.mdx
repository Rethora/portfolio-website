## About

Cursor elevates development productivity by integrating a built-in coding assistant powered by GPT-4.

## Contributions

Having eagerly joined the project during its open-source phase, I found the product remarkable even in its initial stages. Identifying an opportunity for enhancement, I focused on refining the built-in terminal experience. My contributions encompassed the introduction of multiple tabbable terminal sessions using xterm, along with the incorporation of terminal search functionality complemented by intuitive keybindings.
