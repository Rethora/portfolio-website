## About

I actively participated in enhancing an open-source project to meet specific requirements while working on an app that involved incorporating quizzes. Recognizing the need for additional features not present in the existing library, I introduced functionalities such as on-complete actions, per-question actions, and the ability to disable the default on-complete page. Additionally, I addressed various bugs and corrected instances of improper React usages within the project.
