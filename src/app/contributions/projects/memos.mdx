## About

Memos offers an excellent solution for capturing, organizing, and sharing your thoughts seamlessly. Personally, I rely on Memos to meticulously track my private project ideas, making it an invaluable tool for personal productivity.

## Contributions

Upon noticing Memos gaining traction as the top repository on GitHub, I decided to give it a shot. However, a hurdle emerged as a recent commit had disrupted the memo functionality entirely. Swiftly addressing the issue, I submitted a pull request for the fix, which was promptly merged later that day. Since then, I have been seamlessly using Memos.
