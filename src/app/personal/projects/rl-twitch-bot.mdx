## About

These days, I find great enjoyment in playing [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/). While I'm not a regular streamer, occasionally, I initiate a Twitch stream for friends who may not be actively playing but are hanging out. Observing the relatively quiet chat, we decided to inject some liveliness by introducing a Twitch chat bot. True to our idea, I implemented and deployed the bot, transforming the chat into a more engaging and entertaining space.

## Features

### Compliments

Elevate the excitement levels with personalized cheers whenever you score a goal.

### Roasts

Deliver light-hearted roasts whenever an opponent scores against you, adding a humorous twist to the gameplay experience.

## How It Works

- Selenium opens a browser session to watch the stream
- Tesseract extracts the "USER_NAME Scored!" text from the stream
- Fuzzywuzzy compares the extracted text to the configured usernames (your username and/or your teammate's name) to check if it's a match
- Twitch bot sends a random unused message from the provided text file depending on the configured settings
