## About

Active Pixel is a wellness-focused productivity app built for people who spend long hours at their computers. It's easy to lose track of time when you're deep in work. However, prolonged sitting and screen time can take a serious toll on your health. Active Pixel helps you break that cycle with intelligent, fully customizable reminders to move, stretch, or take a quick mental reset.

Whether you want to boost productivity, avoid burnout, or just feel better throughout the day, Active Pixel adapts to your needs. Based on your preferences and filters, the app suggests short, targeted activities like a quick stretch, mini workout, or mindfulness break and lets you like or dislike suggestions to further personalize your experience.

## Key Features
- Smart notifications based on your productivity levels (under/over-productive)
- Custom reminder schedules, including “Do Not Disturb” windows
- Fixed-time and adaptive activity prompts
- A daily progress tracker to visualize your healthy habits
