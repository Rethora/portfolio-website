## About

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rethora/movie-recommendation-system/main/assets/movie-recommendations.png)](https://github.com/Rethora/movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/assets/movie-recommendations.png)

This application generates a table featuring 10 randomly selected movies for users to rate on a scale from 1 to 10 (or leave unrated if unwatched). Upon submitting their ratings, the program compares them to a CSV file containing ratings from other users. The ratings are then aggregated and sorted to create a list with the highest weighted averages. To enhance user recommendations, I curated a new list by including movies from the most similar users that our current user hasn't rated, ensuring avoidance of recommendations for already-watched films. Once the list reaches the desired length, the recommended movies are displayed to the user.
