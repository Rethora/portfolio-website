## About

I developed a Hangman game as part of a project for my Intermediate Java Programming course. The development adhered to a set of rigorous requirements, encompassing the creation of wireframes for the GUI, the implementation of interfaces, enums, abstraction, inheritance, collections, FileIO, and more The game boasts an intuitive UI that enhances the playing experience. It features dynamic game modes (easy, medium, and hard) each presenting an escalating level of difficulty as words become more challenging and players are allocated fewer attempts.
